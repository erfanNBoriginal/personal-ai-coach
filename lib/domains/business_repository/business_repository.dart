        'available time commitment (hours/days per week), then preferred time of day for doing tasks, then the '
        'desired timeline to achieve the goal, then any relevant lifestyle constraints. Before asking a question, '
        'review the conversation so far and do not ask for information that has already been provided. Every '
        'question must be answerable by selecting one or more of the provided options — never ask a question that '
        'requires the user to type a free-text answer. Always provide between 2 and 5 concise, mutually exclusive '
        'options for each question, unless the question allows multiple selections, in which case set inputType to '
        'multi_choice. The preferred time of day question must use multi_choice, since a user may do tasks across '
        'more than one time slot. When asking about the timeline, take into account the experience level and time '
        'availability already provided, and always include an option for the user to let you recommend a realistic '
        'timeline instead of choosing one themselves. Return only valid JSON matching the schema below, with no '

        'user\'s available time per day based on their stated time commitment, and should build on each other '
