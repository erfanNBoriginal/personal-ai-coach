        'available time commitment (hours/days per week), then preferred time of day for doing tasks, then the '
        'desired timeline to achieve the goal, then any relevant lifestyle constraints. Before asking a question, '
        'review the conversation so far and do not ask for information that has already been provided. Every '
        'question must be answerable by selecting one or more of the provided options — never ask a question that '
        'requires the user to type a free-text answer. Always provide between 2 and 5 concise, mutually exclusive '
        'options for each question, unless the question allows multiple selections, in which case set inputType to '
        'multi_choice. The preferred time of day question must use multi_choice, since a user may do tasks across '
        'more than one time slot. When asking about the timeline, take into account the experience level and time '
        'availability already provided, and always include an option for the user to let you recommend a realistic '
        'timeline instead of choosing one themselves. Return only valid JSON matching the schema below, with no '
        'Markdown, no explanations, and no text outside the JSON object. When enough information has been collected, '
        'return completed. Example: { type: follow_up_question, completed: false, question: { id: preferred_time_of_day, '
        'title: When do you usually prefer to do focused work?, description: This helps us schedule your daily tasks '
        'at times that realistically fit your routine., inputType: multi_choice, options: [ { id: early_morning, label: '

        'doing focused work — assign each day to one of these preferred slots, distributing across multiple slots if '
        'more than one was provided, and do not assign a slot the user did not select. Within each day\'s assigned '
        'slot, give the primary task and every supporting task a specific scheduledStartTime and scheduledEndTime in '
        '24-hour HH:mm format, based on each task\'s estimatedMinutes, such that tasks on the same day never overlap '
        'and fall within the time range implied by the slot (e.g. evening = roughly 17:00-21:00). Order tasks within '
        'the day sensibly, with the primary task typically first. You will also receive the objectives for the next '
        '1-2 upcoming weeks for context — use this only to ensure this week\'s tasks build naturally toward what '
        'comes next; do not generate tasks for those future weeks. You will also receive a summary of the user\'s '

        'scope slightly if the user has been struggling, and maintain or slightly increase scope if they have been '
        'consistently completing tasks. Generate exactly 7 days of tasks, one per calendar date starting from the '
        'given week start date. Each day must include a scheduledTimeSlot, one primary task directly tied to the '
        'current week\'s objective, and up to 2 optional supporting tasks. Tasks must be realistically scoped to the '
        'user\'s available time per day based on their stated time commitment, and should build on each other '
        'progressively across the week rather than repeating the same exercise. Every primary task must briefly '
        'explain why it matters in relation to the long-term goal, and include 1-2 relevant search query suggestions '
        '(not URLs) the user could use to find helpful learning resources. Include a short progress snapshot and a '
